# Introduction

This repository contains all the notes I have taken during my studies at Monash University. The notes are written in Markdown and are converted to PDF using Pandoc. The notes are written in a way that they can be easily converted to PDF, HTML, or any other format supported by Pandoc.

## Course Code
